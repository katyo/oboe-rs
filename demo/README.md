# egui

This is an example based on [agdk-egui example](https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples), using `egui`, `winit` and `wgpu` to run [egui_demo_app](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/egui_demo_app).

To run this on desktop, just do `cargo run` like normal! For mobile, use `cargo android run` and `cargo apple run` respectively (or use `cargo android open` and `cargo apple open` to open in Android Studio and Xcode respectively).
